# SYSC3110Project

The authors of this project are John Khalife, Elyssa Grant, Sandy Alzabadani, and Gillian O'Connell.

This repository presently contains Milestone 1 of the SYSC 3110 project. This deliverable is comprised of a simplified, text-based implementation of Scrabble. This Scrabble game is the 'model' component of the MVC design pattern. This game supports two to four players. On a player's turn, the player will be able to place letters onto the board to create words and will be awarded points based on the letters used in the completed word. A simplified version of the game is used, which discludes blank tiles and premium squares.

The following is a breakdown of the details of future deliverables- outlining how the current implementation of the game will be expanded.

Deliverable 2 will use the game logic of Deliverable 1, but will include a Graphical User Interface. With this change, the Scrabble game will adhere to the complete MVC design pattern. Additionally, a thorough unit testing module will be created to ensure the game operates as intended.

Deliverable 3 will expand upon the simplified game logic of Deliverable 1 and 2, by implementing blank tiles and premium squares. As well, 'AI' players will included, allowing the user to play against the game instead of other people, by developing a strategy algorithm. The game will support multiple 'AI' players within a game.

Deliverable 4 will further expand upon the game logic. These changes will include a multi-level undo/redo feature for players. Additionally, players will be able to save incomplete games and load them in the future to continue playing. Finally, the game will allow users to implement custom boards with varying placements of premium squares for a unique Scrabble experience.
