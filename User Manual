The game accommodates four players. The user is displayed with a GUI consisting of a 15x15 grid of buttons (the board), as well as a row of 7 buttons below labeled as their rack. Each button on the rack will display a random letter. On the right is an uneditable text panel, and on the very bottom are three buttons that say "Submit", "Exchange", and "Pass turn".


Playing letters on the board:

1. The user can click a button on their rack, which will indicate that they want to use that letter this turn.

2. Once a letter has been clicked, an empty location on the board can be clicked to indicate that the user wants to add the last letter clicked to that location on the board.

3. Once the user has chosen all the letters and locations on the board they want, they click the "Submit" button, which will attempt to add their submitted letters to the correct locations on the board. If successful, their word will then display on the board in a non-editable form, their updated score will be shown, and the rack for the next player will be displayed.


Exchanging letters with the bag:

1. The user clicks any letters on their rack that they wish to exchange with the bag.

2. Once they have selected all the letters they want to exchange, the user clicks the "Exchange" button. The scores of all players will be displayed, and the rack for the next player will be displayed


Passing a turn:

1. The user clicks "Pass turn", and their turn will be skipped. The scores will be displayed and the next player's rack will appear for them to play their turn. 


The game ends when the letter bag runs out of letters and at least one of the playersâ€™ racks runs out of letters. The player with the highest score wins.
