The game accommodates four players. The user is displayed with a random selection of 7 letters. The user is then prompted with the main menu consisting of three options; Place Letters, Exchange Letters, and Pass Turn. 

1.	Place Letters option allows the user to select the number of letters they want to place on the board. 
The user is then asked to enter the index of the letter they would like to start with based on the given rack of letters. 
The user is then prompted to pick the location of where they want the letter to be placed on the board, based on the scrabble notation [Row][Column] ex. A1. 
This is repeated for the number of letters selected, until all the selected letters are placed on the board. 
If the word formed or the placement is invalid, a message is displayed to the user stating that its invalid and the main menu is redisplayed. 
If the word placement and the formed word is valid, the letters and the locations of the letters selected are displayed to the user as well as a display of the board. 
The main menu is then redisplayed.

2.	Exchange Letters option allows the user to exchange a letter from the rack with a letter from the bag. The user is prompted with a message asking how many letters the user would like to exchange and which letters from the rack the user would like to exchange. 

3.	Pass turn option allows the user to pass the game to the next player and the main menu is redisplayed with a new rack to the next player.

The game ends when the letter bag runs out of letters and at least one of the playersâ€™ racks runs out of letters. The player with the highest score wins.
