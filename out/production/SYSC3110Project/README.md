# SYSC3110Project

The authors of this project are John Khalife, Elyssa Grant, Sandy Alzabadani, and Gillian O'Connell.

This repository presently contains Milestone 3 of the SYSC 3110 project. This deliverable is comprised of a standard Java GUI-based version of Scrabble. This Scrabble game implements the MVC design pattern. This game supports two to four players. This version of the game supports AI players, to allow users to play against the game as opposed to other people or to add to the group of players. On a player's turn, the player will be able to place letters onto the board to create words and will be awarded points based on the letters used in the completed word. This game contains full Scabble features, which include blank tiles for custom letter placement and premium squares for bonus points awarded depending on a word's location on the board.

Presently, this game lacks certain features that are yet to be implemented. Checks for menu items that will restart or quit the game are present in the Controller, but do not exist in the actual implementation.

The following is a breakdown of the details of future deliverables- outlining how the current implementation of the game will be expanded.

Deliverable 4 will include features to enhance the user experience. These changes will include a multi-level undo/redo feature for players. Additionally, players can save incomplete games and load them in the future to continue playing. The game logic will be further expanded to allow users to implement custom boards with varying placements of premium squares.

Overall, future deliverables aim to enhance the user experience by adding a more attractive interface and expanding the current features to offer a unique Scrabble game each time.
